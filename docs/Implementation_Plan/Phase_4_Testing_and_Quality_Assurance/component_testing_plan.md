## Coverage Goals

- **Phase 1**: Reach 90% coverage for core components (BookCard, StarRating, SearchBar, Pagination, RatingFilter, RatingSummary)
  - Progress: SearchBar (100%), StarRating (93.1%), BookCard (51.21%), Pagination (100%), RatingFilter (100%), RatingSummary (100%)
- **Phase 2**: Reach 90% coverage for form and layout components
  - Progress: LoginForm (100%), RegisterForm (100%), Navbar (100%), Footer (100%), Layout (100%)
- **Phase 3**: Reach 90% overall coverage for frontend components

## Testing Challenges

### BookCard Component
- The favorite button is only visible on hover, making it difficult to test using standard DOM testing methods.
- Error handling code in `handleFavoriteToggle` (lines 54-95) is challenging to test due to the hover-only UI.
- We've implemented tests for all the accessible functionality and documented the hover-related limitations.

### StarRating Component
- Excellent test coverage at 93.1% for statements, 88.37% for branches, and 75% for functions.
- The only uncovered lines (84-85) relate to the rating text display when hoverRating is 0.

### SearchBar Component
- Complete test coverage at 100% for statements, branches, functions, and lines.
- All features thoroughly tested including filtering, clearing, input handling, and accessibility.

### Pagination Component
- Complete test coverage at 100% for statements, branches, functions, and lines.
- All functionality thoroughly tested including edge cases with different page counts.
- Includes accessibility testing with proper ARIA attributes.

### RatingFilter Component
- Complete test coverage at 100% for statements, branches, functions, and lines.
- All features thoroughly tested including filter clearing and interactions.

### RatingSummary Component
- Complete test coverage at 100% for statements, branches, functions, and lines.
- All features thoroughly tested including distribution visualization and accessibility.
- Edge cases like singular/plural reviews and empty distributions tested.

### Layout Components
- Complete test coverage at 100% for Navbar, Footer, and Layout components
- Successfully mocked auth context for Navbar authentication state testing
- Tested both authenticated and unauthenticated states in Navbar
- Tested Layout rendering with different props and child content

### Authentication Form Components
- Complete test coverage at 100% for LoginForm and RegisterForm components
- Tested form validation, submission handling, and error states
- Verified proper integration with authentication context

### Review Components
- Complete test coverage at 100% for ReviewForm, ReviewList, and UserReviews components
- Tested form submission, validation, and error handling in ReviewForm
- Verified pagination, sorting, and filtering functionality in ReviewList
- Tested review editing and deletion functionality
- Verified proper rendering of reviews in different states (loading, empty, error)

## Next Steps

### Priority Components to Test

1. **Container Components**
   - `BookList.tsx` - Book display and filtering
   - `UserFavorites.tsx` - User-specific favorite books management

2. **Recommendation Components**
   - `RecommendationCard.tsx`
   - `RecommendationList.tsx`

## Testing Helper Functions

To improve testing efficiency, we'll create the following test helper functions:

1. **Authentication Helpers**
   - Mock authentication context with different states
   - Simulate login/logout actions

2. **Form Testing Helpers**
   - Functions for filling out and submitting common forms
   - Validation testing utilities

3. **API Mocking Helpers**
   - Standardized approach for mocking API responses
   - Error simulation utilities

## Coverage Goals

- **Phase 1**: Reach 90% coverage for core components (BookCard, StarRating, SearchBar, Pagination)
- **Phase 2**: Reach 90% coverage for form components
- **Phase 3**: Reach 90% overall coverage for frontend components

## Special Testing Considerations

### Hover States
For components with hover-dependent UI elements:
- Document the hover-dependency in tests
- Consider refactoring components to make testing easier
- Use alternative testing approaches when direct testing isn't possible

### Async Operations
For components with async operations:
- Use `waitFor` consistently to handle timing issues
- Mock all API calls to prevent flaky tests
- Test both success and error paths

### Context-Dependent Components
For components that depend on React Context:
- Create standard context mock providers
- Test with different context values
- For authentication context, use module-level mocking with jest.mock()
- For components that use useAuth(), cast it as jest.Mock to control its behavior in tests

### Complex UI Interactions
For components with complex interactions:
- Break tests into smaller, focused test cases
- Use user-event library for more realistic user interactions
