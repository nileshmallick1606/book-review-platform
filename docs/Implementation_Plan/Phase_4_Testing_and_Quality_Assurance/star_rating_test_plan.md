# StarRating Component Test Plan

## Component Overview
The StarRating component displays star ratings and optionally allows users to set ratings. It's used throughout the application for both showing book ratings and allowing users to submit their own ratings.

## Current Status
- Current Coverage: 55.17% statements, 55.81% branches, 50% functions
- Uncovered Lines: 39-40, 58-71, 83-85

## Test Cases to Implement

### 1. Basic Rendering Tests

- [x] Test that it renders the correct number of filled stars based on the value
- [x] Test that it renders in read-only mode correctly

### 2. Interactive Mode Tests

- [ ] Test that clicking on a star calls the onChange handler with the correct value
- [ ] Test that hovering over stars updates the display temporarily
- [ ] Test that moving the mouse away from stars restores the original value
- [ ] Test that the component doesn't allow interaction when disabled

### 3. Edge Cases

- [ ] Test with value = 0 (should show all empty stars)
- [ ] Test with maximum value (should show all filled stars)
- [ ] Test with invalid values (negative or greater than max)
- [ ] Test with fractional values (should round appropriately)

### 4. Size and Color Variations

- [ ] Test that different size props render stars with appropriate CSS classes
- [ ] Test that different color themes are applied correctly

### 5. Accessibility Tests

- [ ] Test keyboard navigation for interactive mode
- [ ] Test that appropriate ARIA attributes are present
- [ ] Test that the component is focusable when interactive

## Testing Strategy

1. For each test case, create a separate test function with clear, descriptive name
2. Use test-utils.tsx for consistent rendering
3. Use userEvent for more realistic user interactions when testing hover states
4. Mock onChange handler and verify it's called with expected values

## Implementation Plan

1. Implement basic tests for edge cases first
2. Add tests for interactive functionality
3. Add tests for appearance variations
4. Add accessibility tests

## Expected Challenges

- Testing hover states may require special handling with userEvent
- Ensuring all branches of conditional rendering are covered
- Testing fractional values and rounding behavior

## Success Criteria

- Achieve >90% statement, branch, and function coverage
- All interactive features thoroughly tested
- Edge cases properly handled and tested
