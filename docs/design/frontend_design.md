|   Next.js App     |
+-------------------+
| - pages/          |
| - components/     |
| - services/       |
| - store/          |
| - utils/          |

### Component Breakdown
- **pages/**: Route-based views (Home, Books, Book Details, Profile, Login/Register)
- **components/**: Reusable UI elements (BookCard, ReviewForm, RatingStars, etc.)
- **services/**: API integration (Axios-based)
- **store/**: State management (Context API or Redux)
- **utils/**: Utility functions

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements
- Responsive design (mobile & desktop)
- Fast load times and smooth navigation
- Secure handling of JWT tokens
- Accessibility (WCAG compliance)
- Browser support: Chrome (desktop & mobile)

## 4. Technology Stack
- **Framework:** Next.js (React)
- **State Management:** Context API or Redux
- **UI Library:** Basic component library (custom or minimal third-party)
- **HTTP Client:** Axios
- **Linting/Formatting:** ESLint, Prettier

## 5. Key Design Decisions
- Use Next.js for SSR and fast client-side navigation
- Centralized API service for backend communication
- JWT stored in HttpOnly cookies for security
- Modular component structure for maintainability
- Minimal dependencies for performance

## 6. Data Flow & Integration Points
- All data fetched via RESTful API endpoints
- Authentication handled via JWT
- Book recommendations fetched from backend (which integrates OpenAI API)
- Reviews and ratings update book details in real-time

## 7. Security Considerations
- Input validation on forms
- Secure token storage
- Error handling and user feedback

## 8. Deployment
- Static export or server-side deployment (Vercel, Netlify, etc.)
- CI/CD pipeline for automated builds and deployments
